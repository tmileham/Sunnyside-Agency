## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3, including Flexbox for layout
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was the first complete website I've made using flexbox. The mobile menu which transitions off and on the screen using event listeners using vanilla javascript.

I also had my first experience with reverting changes using git.
